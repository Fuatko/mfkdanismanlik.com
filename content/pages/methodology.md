## How We Work

Our methodology combines rigor with flexibility. We bring structure where it matters and adapt where context demands it.

## Five-Step Process

1. **Discover** — Understand your context, goals, and constraints
2. **Diagnose** — Analyze data, map processes, identify root causes
3. **Design** — Develop recommendations and implementation roadmap
4. **Deliver** — Execute with your team, building capabilities along the way
5. **Sustain** — Embed changes, measure outcomes, iterate as needed

## Our Toolbox

We use industry-standard frameworks and tools: balanced scorecards, value stream mapping, stakeholder analysis, and more. Each engagement selects the right tools for your situation.
